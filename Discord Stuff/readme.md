## Discord-Whook
```
This is a simple Web Hook message to your discord server. Enter a web hook URL in it that you get from your server and send messages from your home or remote servers to your channel.
```
## Discord-Embed
```
This is the same as above but it uses a simple rich presence to send it to the channel. Update: you can send a message now without quotes. [Discord-Embed.ps1 Any message you want to send]
