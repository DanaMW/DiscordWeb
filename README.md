# Discord Nick Handler <a href="https://github.com/DanaMW/DiscordWeb/raw/master/DiscordNickHandler.user.js" class="button"><img src="/img/icon32.png"></a>
```
I like to assign colors to friends.
Even more I like to assign insulting nicks.
With this script you can alter what someones nick shows on a server.
You can assign nicks colors of your choice.
And it has a friends color nick (sort of the same).
Edit the script directly to add or remove nicknames or colors.
